    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "***max depth 1 (high bias)***\n",
    "\n",
    "If the maximum depth is only 1, the scores for training and test are relatively close to each other, but only reach a very low score. This is an error due to incorrect or simplified assumptions on the learning algorithm used. Bias is often the cause for underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***max depth 10 (high variance)***\n",
    "\n",
    "If the maximum depth is 10 you can clearly see that this model has been overtrained. On the training data it is well trained and delivers a perfect result. However, it is not able to generalize enough with the test data to give a good result.  The model has too many trainable features which is characteristic for a high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "This graph clearly shows that the greater the \"maximum depth\", the more the model tends to overfit. In the range of 1-3 the model shows an underfitting, with 4 the ideal point is reached. From 5 the model tends to overfitting. "

    "* Which maximum depth do you think results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data? \n",
    "* What intuition lead you to this answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

    "The Grid Search is a method to determine the best hyper-parameters for a learning algorithm and the estimator that provides the best prediction.\n",
    "In the case of the DecisionTreeRegressor used in this project, hyper-parameters are e.g. max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf etc.\n",
    "The Grid Search allows to specify several values for the parameter max_depth e.g. 1, 3, 6, 10 and also for min_samples_split e.g. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. \n",
    "Then all possible variants are tested automatically (bruteforce) and the best estimator is determined. In this case the combination with the highest R^2 score is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "***What arguments/ inputs go into doing gridSearch?***  \n",
    "In this case the \"regressor\" (object of DecisionTreeRegressor), a dictionary of params ({'max_depth':[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]}), the scoring function and a cross-validation sets (ShuffleSplit).\n",

    "***What does the grid signify in a gridSearch?***  \n",

    "\n",
    "***Will the performance metric be same for all kinds of problems?***  \n",
    "The performance metric is not the same for every kind problem. It can be e.g. accuracy_score, mean_squared_error, average_precision, etc.. The make_scorer() function transforms the performance metric into a scoring function which is passed via the \"scoring\" parameter when creating the GridSearchCV object.\n",
    "\n",
    "***What is the difference between hyper-parameter and parameter?***  \n",
    "The difference between parameters and hyper-parameters is, that the hyperparameter cannot be learned directly in the estimator. \n",
    "A hyper parameter is provided to the model such as the learning rate, number of hidden layers in a neural network, kernel of a SVM etc.\n",
    "While parameters are those which would be learned like weights and biases. \n",
    "\n",
    "***How would each model with a specific hyper-parameter combination be checked in the pool of models?***  \n",
    "The GridSearchCV instance implements the usual estimator API: when “fitting” it on a dataset all the possible combinations of parameter values are evaluated and the best combination is retained.\n"

    "\n",
    "When thinking about how k-fold cross validation helps grid search, think about the main drawbacks of grid search which are hinged upon **using a particular subset of data for training or testing** and how k-fold cv could help alleviate that.

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After splitting the data into training and test data, K-Fold is applied to the training data.  \n",
    "The training data is partitioned into k bins of the same size (each subset is called a fold). One set is used for cross validation, the remaining k-1 folds for training. Then the Model is trained on the k-1 trainings sets and the accuracy is calculated against the cross validation set.\n",
    "This process will repeated k times, each time with a different cross-validation set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated for all combinations of hyperparameters in the grid (gridSearch).\n",
    "For one entire K-Fold cross validation process (splitting into k folds, training and validation) the selected hyper-parameters remain the same. This helps to get an unbiased estimate of model evaluation metric which helps to decide in a more unbiased way, whether the given combination of hyperparameters is best for the particular data set or not.  \n",
    "Once the best parameters are selected with gridSearch along with the K-fold cross-validation, then the test set is used to check the final performance of the model."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.20/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.model_selection` to create a grid search object.\n",
    "  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n",
